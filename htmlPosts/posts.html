              <p>Importance: Waxing your snowboard not only enhances its glide over the snow but also protects the base from abrasions and drying out. A well-waxed board can significantly improve your speed and maneuverability. Frequency: How often you need to wax your board depends on how frequently you ride. As a general rule, waxing every 3 to 5 days of riding is recommended. However, if you're riding in particularly icy conditions or notice the base looking dry and white, it's time for a wax.</p>
